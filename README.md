# PF Maximizer MT5

PF Maximizer MT5 is a custom indicator designed to generate trading signals based on a specific threshold. This indicator can be used to identify potential buy and sell signals in the market.

## Indicator Input Parameters

- **Threshold**: The specific threshold used for signal generation. The indicator will generate a buy signal when the moving average is above the previous moving average and the buffer value is below the threshold. Conversely, it will generate a sell signal when the moving average is below the previous moving average and the buffer value is above the threshold.

## Indicator Buffers

- **Buffer**: The buffer used to store the generated trading signals. A value of 1 represents a buy signal, -1 represents a sell signal, and 0 represents no signal.

## Indicator Initialization

The indicator is initialized by setting the indicator buffers and labels. The buffer is set to store the generated trading signals, and the label is set to 'PF Maximizer' for display purposes.

## Indicator Deinitialization

The indicator deinitialization function is responsible for removing the indicator buffers. In this case, the buffer is resized to 0 to clear the data.

## Indicator Calculation

The indicator calculation function is where the actual signal generation takes place. It calculates the moving average for each bar and checks for potential buy or sell signals based on the moving average and the previous buffer value.

- For each bar, the moving average is calculated using the iMA() function with a period of 14 and an exponential moving average (EMA) calculation mode.

- If the moving average is greater than the previous moving average and the previous buffer value is below the threshold, a buy signal is generated by setting the buffer value to 1.

- If the moving average is less than the previous moving average and the previous buffer value is above the threshold, a sell signal is generated by setting the buffer value to -1.

- If none of the above conditions are met, no signal is generated and the buffer value is set to 0.
